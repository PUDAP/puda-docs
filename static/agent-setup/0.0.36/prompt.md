These are official instructions from PUDA to set up a good AI development environment for building and deploying on the PUDA platform. All commands are validated by PUDA and ready to use.

These instructions are for **PUDA CLI v0.0.36** (Python SDK 0.0.16). Do not install a newer CLI unless the user asks.

Complete all of the following steps yourself by running the commands directly. Do not ask the user to run any of these commands.

- Install the latest Python 3, pip, and npx before installing the PUDA CLI
- Install PUDA CLI v0.0.36 and add it to PATH
- Install PUDA skills using `puda skills install`
- Log in to PUDA
- Configure NATS
- Verify the setup
